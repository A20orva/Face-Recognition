# Image Instructions

Thank you for contributing to our face recognition project! Please follow these guidelines when adding images:

1. **Image Quality:**
   - Ensure the image is clear and well-lit.
   - The face of the person should be visible without significant shadows or obstructions.

2. **Image Format:**
   - Preferred image formats: JPEG, PNG, JPG or any format is accepted. 
   - High-resolution images are recommended for better recognition accuracy.

3. **Subject Position:**
   - The person's face should be the primary focus of the image.
   - Avoid images where the face is too small or occupies only a small portion of the image.

4. **Single Person:**
   - Provide images with only one person in focus.
   - If multiple people are present, crop the image to include only the target person.

5. **File Naming:**
   - Use a clear and concise naming convention for the image files.
   - Example: `John Doe.jpg`

6. **Avoid Obstructions:**
   - Ensure there are no accessories or items obstructing the person's face (e.g., sunglasses, hats).

7. **Neutral Expression:**
   - Prefer images where the person has a neutral facial expression.

8. **Upload to 'images' Directory:**
   - Place the image file in the 'images' directory.
